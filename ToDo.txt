Things to do:


- implement money and fix destrectible object actor.

- Create "Burst" spell - press spell button, time slows down (maybe), quickly give it a direction with controller, 
  and then an impulse is added to the ball toward that direction.
- Implement dodgeball field

- Block out enemy 1 which is a Gobloon, a throwing trash guy that is a mux of a goblin and a racoon.
- blockout enemy 2 which is the Beowlder, a eye-lasing guy which is a mix of beholder and a owl
- blockout the boss which is a mix of enemy 1 and 2 mechanically.
